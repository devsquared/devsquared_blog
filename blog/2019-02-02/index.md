Built a new blog with Gatsby.js and a great starter. Here I plan to do book
reviews, tech posts, and much more! 

## A little bit about me!
I am a software developer currently working in Norman, OK. I graduated from 
the University of Oklahoma where I studied and earned a BS in Mathematics. 
I enjoy long distance running, cycling, reading, and coffee. In the context of 
software development, I enjoy automated testing, machine learning, and 
learning in general. 

Let's be friends!

Cheers!
