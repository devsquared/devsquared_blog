So Paul George very well may have had a major impact on this years NBA playoffs, at least the western side of the bracket. This impact came from a single shot - a [buzzer beater to beat the Rockets](<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ethe4x7Mnfo>) on Tuesday. Let's ignore the fact that there was a plethora of other things that had to be right in this moment, because nobody cares about the fact that the Death Star had a single meter-wide point of failure. They only care about the amazing moment when Luke glided through a trench, disabled the automated aiming system, and then [blew the Empire's toy to pieces](<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuKqcfO31is&t=3s>).  So, let's just look at that sweet moment that the ball swished through that beautiful twine net. And what it could and has caused.

For a little more context, let's explain where everything ended up right after that shot went through. That shot put the Thunder at 48-33 heading into the final game. They sat at 6th in the West at that point with on game to play. It put the Rockets finishing the regular season at 53-29. They sat at 3rd in the West then. If the season would have ended right then and there, the Western conference playoffs would have looked like this:

\- Golden State Warriors vs Los Angeles Clippers

\- Denver Nuggets vs San Antonio Spurs

\- Houston Rockets vs Oklahoma City Thunder

\- Portland Trail Blazers vs Utah Jazz

Let's look at how each team did in their final regular season game and how the playoff picture ended up as it did.

## Clippers Sail in

The Clippers final day was filled with potential. With a win and a few losses from the teams around them, the Clips could have moved all the way up to 6th. They were to play the Jazz who were already locked into the 5th slot. Utah put up a fight though. The game ended in overtime with the Clippers pulling away. However, the waters didn't clear up as the teams around them ended up winning. This locked the Clippers into the 8th spot with, almost certainly, impending doom looming in the mighty Warriors.

Since the Warriors game did not matter, we have our first matchup of the playoffs for the West:

\- Golden State Warriors vs Los Angeles Clippers

## Spurs Still Kickin'

Spurs also had a fair amount of potential with moving up with a win and a Thunder loss. They also got to sit and wait to see who the first round opponent they would end up facing (more on that in a second). Spurs faced the Mavs and were tasked with spoiling Dirk's final NBA game. They did as such fairly easily and waited for the rest of the fray to unfold to know where they landed.

## Nuggets Find Gold

After a year that saw Denver missing the playoffs, the Nuggets claw their way all the way up towards the top. The young squad, built around a skilled big man in Jokic, surprised a lot of people with the way they kept finding ways to win. Their final day had a little potential - ultimately, win and stay in the 2 slot. If they were to lose, there were a few scenarios with the most likely being slotted to 3. Winning they did though; dispatching the Timberwolves. This slotted them firmly into the 2 seed which makes the turnaround even better for them this year.

## Thunder Glide In

Going into the game versus the Rockets on Tuesday, it seemed like the Thunder were destined to be an 8th seed. It felt like a free fall that would end with an inevitable spanking from the Golden Boys from the Bay. Then, Paul George hit a shot that sent me into a state of incredible excitement and this plummet turned into a nice rise. I like to picture that Paul George is Tom Cruise in Top Gun pulling a fighter jet out of a dive with perfection.

The Thunder still had plenty of possibilities for the final night. The seeds that they could end up in were 6-8. The good thing was that Giannis "the Perfect Human for Basketball" Antetokounmpo was to sit out the game. Though this was offset when it was announced that Paul George would also be missing the affair. However, the Thunder pulled it off. And this slotted them into the 6th spot, which is still mind boggling since the Thunder always struggle if it is past the All-Star Break.

All seemed set until...

## Blazers from the Top Rope

Going into the last day, Portland seemed to be content with a 4th seed finish and a matchup with the Jazz. They played the Kings (a great season for the Kings by the way) who were already eliminated from anything meaningful by this point. The second half of this game started with the Kings up by 25 points. The Blazers also were playing only 6 players like it was an intramural game or something. At that moment, the Thunder were locked into playing the Rockets and scheming on who should try and stop Harden in the first round. But then, Anfernee Simons (a rookie no less) decided to carry the 6-man squad from Portland all the way back from the huge deficit. NBA Twitter went crazy and Portland changed the layout of the Playoffs. Portland stomped the Rockets down a slot and took the 3 seed from Houston's idle hands. This was drastic, but more on that in a second.

## Final Western Conference Standings

So after all of this craziness, here is what the playoff picture looks like for the Western Conference:

\- Golden State Warriors vs Los Angeles Clippers

\- Denver Nuggets vs San Antonio Spurs

\- Portland Trail Blazers vs Oklahoma City Thunder

\- Houston Rockets vs Utah Jazz

Now letâ€™s talk about why this scenario is pretty crazy. Prior to this season, the going thought was that the only true threat to the Warriors run at the Western Conference Title was Houston (with a few others having much lower chances). This matchup, then, should be the actual Western Conference Finals matchup in theory. That is now impossible as assuming wins for Houston and Golden State in the first round, they match up in the second round. This opens up a pathway for every other team on the opposite side - Denver, OKC, Trail Blazers, and Spurs. Further, if the Rockets or Warriors have to   expend a lot of energy to defeat this thought-to-be biggest obstacle, the western conference could have a surprising victor.

There are a few other smaller interesting pieces that this opens up as well. For instance, we now have the Nuggets, a team with very little playoff experience, slotted to play the Spurs, a team that is known for being a force in the playoffs every single year. We have the Thunder playing the Blazers. The Thunder are the lower seed but also won all 4 games against the Blazers during the regular season. But with a series of games in the playoffs, some of these smaller story lines mean a little less.

## Paul George and the Shot

Let's head back to that fateful shot and recap what this set into motion.

OKC vs Houston on April 9th was the Rockets final game. A win and the Rockets are guaranteed to be the 2 seed. This also hands the Thunder a loss and an all-but-certain slot as the 8 seed. Paul George winning at the buzzer potentially gives a lot of reclaimed hope to the Thunder. With a loss, the Thunder are a likely first round exit (again). With this shot and win, they can now be comfortable that the biggest foe (and rival) Golden State is far away. And look at a much more open side of the bracket with a chance to play for a Western Conference Finals title.

I like to think of Paul George pushing a teetering boulder to start its roll down a mountain. Then, the next night the Blazers full-on Chuck-Norris-in-his-prime drop-kicked that sucker into a rolling boulder of Western Conference mayhem. And it seems the Rockets may be the heel that the boulder is nipping at.

The NBA Playoffs look to be an exciting time this year!
