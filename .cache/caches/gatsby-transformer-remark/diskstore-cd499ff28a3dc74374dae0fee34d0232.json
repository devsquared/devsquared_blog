For instance, we now have the Nuggets, a team with very little playoff experience, slotted to play the Spurs, a team that is known for being a force in the playoffs every single year. We have the Thunder playing the Blazers. The Thunder are the lower seed but also won all 4 games against the Blazers during the regular season. But with a series of games in the playoffs, some of these smaller story lines mean a little less.","position":{"start":{"line":58,"column":1,"offset":6133},"end":{"line":58,"column":503,"offset":6635}}}],"position":{"start":{"line":58,"column":1,"offset":6133},"end":{"line":58,"column":503,"offset":6635}}},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tagName":"h2","properties":{"id":"paul-george-and-the-shot"},"children":[{"type":"element","tagName":"a","properties":{"href":"#paul-george-and-the-shot","aria-hidden":true,"class":"anchor"},"children":[{"type":"raw","value":"<svg aria-hidden=\"true\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg>"}]},{"type":"text","value":"Paul George and the Shot","position":{"start":{"line":60,"column":4,"offset":6640},"end":{"line":60,"column":28,"offset":6664}}}],"position":{"start":{"line":60,"column":1,"offset":6637},"end":{"line":60,"column":28,"offset":6664}}},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Let's head back to that fateful shot and recap what this set into motion.","position":{"start":{"line":62,"column":1,"offset":6666},"end":{"line":62,"column":74,"offset":6739}}}],"position":{"start":{"line":62,"column":1,"offset":6666},"end":{"line":62,"column":74,"offset":6739}}},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"OKC vs Houston on April 9th was the Rockets final game.
