It was so good that that night I created a custom slide theme after it. The talk itself was about evolutionary architecture and getting your application there. She talked about applying a fitness function to your architecture with which to constantly measure your applications health and gain insights into what needs to be done. This fitness function created with multiple \"-ilities\" (maintainability, testability, scalability, etc), but - crucially - not all of the \"-ilities\". Also priorities on what needs to be fixed and done first.
